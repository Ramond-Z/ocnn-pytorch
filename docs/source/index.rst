This repository contains the **pure PyTorch**-based implementation of
`O-CNN <https://wang-ps.github.io/O-CNN.html>`_. The code has been tested with
`Pytorch>=1.6.0`, and `Pytorch>=1.9.0` is preferred. The *original*
implementation of O-CNN is based on C++ and CUDA and can be found
`here <https://github.com/Microsoft/O-CNN>`_, which has received over `730 stars`.


O-CNN is an octree-based 3D convolutional neural network framework for 3D data.
O-CNN constrains the CNN storage and computation into non-empty sparse voxels
for efficiency and uses the `octree` data structure to organize and index these
sparse voxels. Currently, this type of 3D convolution is known as Sparse
Convolution in the research community.

The concept of Sparse Convolution in O-CNN is the same as
`SparseConvNet <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Graham_3D_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf>`_,
`MinkowskiNet <https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine>`_, and
`SpConv <https://github.com/traveller59/spconv>`_.
The key difference is that our O-CNN uses `octrees` to index the sparse voxels,
while these works use `Hash Tables`. However, I believe that `octrees` may be
the right choice for Sparse Convolution. With `octrees`, I can implement the
Sparse Convolution with pure PyTorch. More importantly, with `octrees`, I can
also build efficient transformers for 3D data --
`OctFormer <https://github.com/octree-nn/octformer>`_, which is extremely hard
with `Hash Tables`.

Our O-CNN is published in SIGGRAPH 2017, SparseConvNet is published in CVPR
2018, and MinkowskiNet is published in CVPR 2019. Actually, our O-CNN was
submitted to SIGGRAPH at the end of 2016 and was officially accepted in March
2017.
We just did not post our paper on Arxiv during the review process of SIGGRAPH.
Therefore, **the idea of constraining CNN computation into sparse non-empty
voxels, i.e. Sparse Convolution, is first proposed by our O-CNN**.
